The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a web page in a tree-like format, making it possible for programming languages like JavaScript to interact with, modify, and manipulate the content, structure, and style of a webpage dynamically.
The 'document' object provides methods to access and manipulate the HTML elements in your webpage.
The 'onclick' attribute is an event handler. It specifies that a function should execute when the button is clicked.
The <script> tag in HTML is used to include JavaScript code in a web page.It can either contain JavaScript directly or link to an external JavaScript file.The src attribute specifies the location of an external JavaScript file 
The 'innerText' property is used to get or set the text content inside an HTML element. In this case, it is being set to the value of the variable count.
The rel="stylesheet" attribute in the <link> tag is used to link an external CSS file to an HTML document. The rel="icon" attribute in the <link> tag is used to specify the favicon for a webpage. A favicon is the small icon that appears in the browser's tab, title bar, bookmark list, and other areas where the site is identified visually.
