When retrieving that data using localStorage.getItem(), it comes back as a string, regardless of the original data type.
The JSON.parse() method in JavaScript is used to convert a JSON-formatted string into a JavaScript object or array. This is necessary because data retrieved from a server or stored as JSON is typically in string format, and JSON.parse() makes it usable in JavaScript.
The JSON.stringify() method in JavaScript is used to convert a JavaScript object, array, or value into a JSON-formatted string. This is the reverse of JSON.parse().
